  <h2>Lesson 1. Basic Lisp</h2>

  <p>ACL2 uses a subset of the Lisp programming language. Lisp's syntax is one
  of the simplest. However, it is quite different from most other languages, so
  let's take a moment to get acquainted with it.</p>

  <p>First of all, every operation in Lisp is a function. Even very basic
  mathematical operations, such as addition. Secondly, functions are called in
  a different way than they are in mathematics or in most other languages.
  While in most languages, you might write <code>f(x, y)</code>, in Lisp, you
  write <code>(f x y)</code>.</p>

  <p>The addition function is called <code>+</code>. Try adding two numbers
  now: <code>(+ 1 2)</code></p>

  ACL2 is:
  <ul>
    <li> A Compuational Logic: A complex mechanized theorem prover that can
         reason about code written in...
    <li> Applicitave Common Lisp: A significantly restricted subset of Common
         Lisp that doesn't allow for variables to be modified in place.
